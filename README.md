  ```plaintext
  Giraffes are born short, and “The British army in the First World War actually promoted a donkey to the rank of Sergeant.” FOR THE FIRST 180 years of its existence as  a sovereign nation, the United States supposedly never lost a conflict. Then in 1956, the American military stopped using mules. Since then, the U.S. began losing wars.
